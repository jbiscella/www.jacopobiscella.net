## 1. **Definition and Overview**

### **What is Smoke Testing?**
Smoke testing, often termed as "sanity testing", is a preliminary testing technique used to ascertain whether a software build is stable for more rigorous testing. It involves executing a subset of test cases that touch upon the primary functions of the application. The objective is not to catch every bug but to identify any major, show-stopping issues that would prevent further, in-depth testing.

### **Historical Context: Origins of the Term**
The term "smoke testing" is borrowed from plumbing, where smoke is introduced into pipes to check for leaks. Similarly, in software, the idea is to see if the software runs (i.e., "smokes") under basic operation without immediately breaking down.

### **The Need for Smoke Testing in Software Development**
In software development, especially in agile environments, where frequent changes are a norm, smoke testing serves as an early warning system. It helps:

- **Quick Feedback**: To developers about the fundamental soundness of their code.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort in cases where a build has significant issues.
- **Confidence**: Provides a level of assurance that the build is ready for further testing, such as integration or functional tests.
