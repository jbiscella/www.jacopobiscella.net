## **1. Introduction**

### **What is a Circuit Breaker?**
   
- Definition: Describing the concept of a circuit breaker in the context of software systems.
- Origins: How the idea is inspired by electrical circuit breakers that prevent overload.
- Analogy: Comparing software circuit breakers to their electrical counterparts.

### **Why Use Circuit Breakers?**

- **Preventing System Overload**: Explaining how circuit breakers prevent systems from being overwhelmed by a high number of requests, especially when downstream services are slow or unresponsive.
  
- **Graceful Degradation**: Highlighting how using circuit breakers can allow a system to continue functioning in a degraded mode, serving non-critical requests or providing fallback responses when primary functionalities are disrupted.

- **Protecting Downstream Services**: Emphasizing the importance of not overloading failing services further, giving them a chance to recover.

- **Enhancing User Experience**: Discussing how users can receive faster feedback or alternative responses instead of waiting indefinitely or receiving generic error messages.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Explaining how preventing cascading failures can save resources and reduce costs associated with system outages and troubleshooting.

### **The Evolution of Circuit Breakers**

- **Historical Context**: A brief look at how systems were traditionally managed during failures and how the need for patterns like circuit breakers emerged.
  
- **Modern Applications**: Discussing the increased relevance of circuit breakers in today's microservices architectures, cloud-native applications, and distributed systems.

### **Comparing Circuit Breakers to Other Resilience Patterns**

- **Retries**: How circuit breakers differ from simple retry mechanisms.
  
- **Rate Limiting**: The distinction between controlling the flow of requests (rate limiting) and halting them under certain conditions (circuit breaking).

- **Timeouts**: Understanding how timeouts and circuit breakers can work together to handle system failures.
